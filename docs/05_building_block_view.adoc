== Building Block View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image:05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.

=== Whitebox Overall System

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

Building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks, it includes libraries, modules, components... An also the dependencies among them.

Motivation::

This diagram shows the relations of the application among many others systems. It also shws dependency relations with clients. This diagram provides readers a general static vision of the project.

Contained Building Blocks::
|===
|Building block |Description
| _Client_ | Interacts with the application. He also takes care of his data using pods. 
| _Database System_ | Service to store data. It is used through mongoDB atlas. Packages (npm): mongodb, mongoose.
| _Solid infrestructure_ | Mechanism to store data taking care of privacy. Packages (npm): _still to decide_.
| _Shipping business_ | Business which makes products' delivery. Developed with picker express API.
| _ArquiSocks_ | The main core of the application.
|===

Important Interfaces::
|===
|Interface |Description
| _Picker Express API_ | Useful to manage orders and shipping prices. 
| _mongodb and  mongoose_ | Optimize database connections and data management
| _Still to decide_ | _TODO_
|===

=== Level 2

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system

==== White Box _ArquiSocks_

image:whitebox_arquisocks.png["Whitebox ArquiSocks"]

Motivation::

This diagram shows the relations between the restapi and the webapp. Both building blocks will be explained more detailed in next paragraphs.

Contained Building Blocks::
|===
|Building block |Description
| _React_ | Library used in order to improve development of Graphic User Interfaces. 
| _Webapp_ | Contains the GUI of the application which is useful for clients usability. 
| _Restapi_ | Contains controllers (routers) in order to manage CRUD requests. Generates responses to the requests.

|===

Important Interfaces::
|===
|Interface |Description
| _Server_ | this element has the responsability of manage requests of application's clients. These requests come from the webapp.
|===

=== Level 3

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 2 as white boxes.

When you need more detailed levels of your architecture please copy this
part of arc42 for additional levels.
****

==== White Box _Restapi_

image:whitebox_restapi.png["Whitebox Restapi"]

Motivation::

This diagram shows the relations among restapi components and libraries used.

Contained Building Blocks::
|===
|Building block |Description
| _Models_ | Stores classes which represent objects form databse. Packages (npm): mongodb.
| _Routes_ | Admin requests and redirect to the service. Includes business logic. Packages (npm): express, mongodb.
| _Service_ | Connects to database. Packages (npm): mongoose, dotenv.
| _Server_ | Manage users' requests. Packages (npm): express, dotenv.
|===

==== White Box _Webapp_

image:whitebox_webapp.png["Whitebox Webapp"]

Motivation::

This diagram shows the relations among webapp components and libraries used. The main lirary is mui used for optimize the development of many components.

Contained Building Blocks::
|===
|Building block |Description
| _Api_ | Contains functions to connect with the restapi.
| _App_ | The main page of the web. Packages (npm): mui.
| _Components_ | Contains all of the components of the webapp, from the cart to the products list. Packages (npm): mui.
| _Contexts_ | It is like the session of the user, it stores products selected.
