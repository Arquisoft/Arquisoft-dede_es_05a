== Building Block View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image:05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.

=== Whitebox Overall System

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

****
Building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks, it includes libraries, modules, components... And also the dependencies among them.

Restapi and webapp are both balck boxes which are explained more detailed scrolling down a little. 

Motivation::

This diagram shows the relations of the application among many others systems. It also shows dependency relations with clients. This diagram provides readers a general static vision of the project.

Contained Building Blocks::
|===
|Building block |Description
| _Client_ | Interacts with the application. He also takes care of his data using pods. 
| _Database System_ | Service to store data. It is used through mongoDB atlas. Packages (npm): mongodb, mongoose.
| _Solid infrastructure_ | Mechanism to store data taking care of privacy. Packages (npm): inrupt/solid-ui-react
| _Maps API_ | API which allow us to manage distances and many other aspects related to addresses.
| _ArquiSocks_ | The main core of the application.
|===

Important Interfaces::
|===
|Interface |Description
| _nodo-fetch_ | Allow us to make asynchronous requests to the maps API so we can get information about coordinates and distances among many addresses. 
| _mongodb and  mongoose_ | Optimize database connections and data management
| _inrupt/solid-ui-react_ | Dependency which allows us to have a connection to solid. In this way we can get information from the pods.

=== Level 2

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 2 as white boxes.

When you need more detailed levels of your architecture please copy this
part of arc42 for additional levels.

==== White Box _Webapp_

image:whitebox_webapp.png["Whitebox Webapp"]

Motivation::

This diagram shows the relations among webapp components and libraries used. The main library is mui used to optimize the development of many components. It has been implemented using *React library for user interfaces*.

Contained Building Blocks::
|===
|Building block |Description
| _Api_ | Contains functions to connect with the restapi.
| _App_ | Main component which contains all other components. Packages (npm): mui.
| _Components_ | Contains all ui components of the webapp, like cart, order, navbar, footer... Packages (npm): mui, inrupt/solid-ui-react.
| _Contexts_ | It allows us to share data across the components more easily. For now, the context is sharing selected products in cart.
|===

==== White Box _Restapi_

image:whitebox_restapi.png["Whitebox Restapi"]

Motivation::

This diagram shows the relations among restapi components and libraries used.

Contained Building Blocks::
|===
|Building block |Description
| _Models_ | Stores classes which represent objects from database. Packages (npm): mongodb.
| _Routes_ | Admin requests and redirect to the service. Includes business logic. Packages (npm): express, mongodb, node-fetch.
| _Service_ | Connects to database. Packages (npm): mongoose, dotenv.
| _Server_ | Manage users' requests. Packages (npm): express, dotenv.
