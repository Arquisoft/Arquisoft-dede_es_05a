.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape the system's architecture. These include

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the basis for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanation of these key decisions short.

Motivate what you have decided and why you decided that way,
based upon your problem statement, the quality goals and key constraints.
Refer to details in the following sections.

.Technology decisions
|===
|Decision|Reason
|MongoDB as DBMS|MongoDB is a non-relational model that is a good choice for this project. However, this decision may change in the future.
|Docker for application deployment|Docker is chosen due to its popularity and there is a lot of information about this technology.
|Visual Studio Code, WebStorm as IDE or a text editor|At the moment, everyone can use any IDE that supports Typescript and React. Or even, it is possible to use a text editor instead of an IDE. Because the project continues working regardless of the used tool. However, an agreement may be fine to avoid potential problems.

.Decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system
|===
|Decision|Reason
|Layered Architecture|Usage of MERN architecture allows us to easily build a 3-tier architecture entirely using only TypeScript and JSON.

.Decisions on how to achieve quality goals
|===
|Decision|Reason
|Online accessibility testing tools|To achieve accessibility
|SOLID|To achieve confidentiality
|NoSQL database|NoSQL database provides easy and fast search and thus efficiency is achieved.
|Usability tests|Perform usability tests throughout development and do not leave for the last moment can help detect usability problems early.
|Server provider|Choose the server provider and the payment plan according to our needs to achieve acceptable availability.

.Organizational decisions
|===
|Decision|Reason
|Kanban Board as work management tool|It allows stakeholders to visualize the workflow. Also, it helps development team to organize their tasks more visually.
|Git Flow as branching strategy|All members have experience with it and find it comfortable. 
|Wiki to record of meeting minutes|It is an integrated tool in GitHub where the project's git repository is.
|Labels are created as needed|For now, create labels as needed and be careful not to duplicate them.
