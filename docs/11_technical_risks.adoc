A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority

.Motivation
“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

.Form
List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.

.List of risks
|===
|Nº|Risk|Explanation|Measures
|1|Abandonment of a team member|It can be caused by different reasons such as personal or organizational problems.|Do not leave an important task or module for a single person. 
|2|Not enough experience on technologies which we need to use.|These technologies are Typescript, React, Node.js, Express and SOLID.|Investigate more about these technologies and practice by following tutorials or online courses. There are also materials provided by teachers.
|3|Problems with git|Team members can have conflicts when merging branches.|Make sure the result is what we expect before running unknown commands. To do this, we can consult the official documentation or ask other members of the team.
|4|Lack of time|This risk is closely related to the others. In addition, team members also have other subjects besides this one.|Combine the completion of this work with the rest of the subjects. 
|5|Unproductive meetings|It can be caused by not making preparations before meetings.|Have a list of topics to talk about during the meeting. 
|6|Lack of communication|The communication is not immediate in most of the time because team members have different schedules.|Team members need to be more collaborative. Another measure is to take advantage of scheduled meetings.
|7|English|It is not the usual language of the team members. Then this documentation can have linguistic errors.|Use the free online dictionary and language error detection tools.

|Nº|Technical debts|Explanation|Measures
|1|Security|There are many paths which should not be accesible for some users.|Checking paths and improving role system in order to check and revert those dangerous requests. These will improve security and decrease hacking risks.
|2|Versions|During development we have used some old versions which have been quite useful. Npm has report many vulnerabilities, there are 6 moderate vulnerailities while installing webapp dependencies|Updating dependencies in order to reduce those vulnerabilities which could be dangerous for application's security.
|3|Azure deployment|Configuration files are created but deployment could not be finished correctly due to many problems of GitHub actions while creating a release|We will try to solve all this problems. However, webpage has been deployed using Heroku and now is available. Trying to have both deployments will be a challenge for us in order to reach some quality goals such as availability.
