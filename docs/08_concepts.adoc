== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

.Elements of the domain model
|===
|Element|Meaning
|User|Representation of users who are logged in.
|Product|Represention of socks of the on-line shop.
|Availability|Save the stock and size of the product.
|OrderProduct|Represents products in orders.
|Order|Represents confirmed orders.
|DistributionCenter|Represents distribution centers that are in charge of send orders.

=== User Experience (UX)
A good User Experience is a key aspect for the success of the application. The application must satisfy the needs of the users in an effective way. For this, several concepts must be taken into account when designing user interfaces  like:

* Usability
* Accesibility

==== Usability
Throughout development, usability tests are carried out on different users. Each test consists of small tasks that test the implemented functionalities. 

Thanks to the user's interactions with the application, usability problems can be detected and it makes it possible to make improvements in this regard. 

Usability problems make the application difficult to use and understand for users. So, it is important to avoid or reduce it.

==== Accesibility
There are different standards to follow to achieve accessibility. One of the standards is WCAG 2.0 (Level AA) which is the most used worldwide. Therefore, it is the one used in this application. 

Tools to use are:

==== User interface
User interfaces should be designed with usability and accessibility in mind.

=== Security
Security is another key aspect to consider. Some of the measures to ensure sacurity are:

* The application does not store private data of the user. To obtain it, the application asks the user for permission to access the Solid POD where the data is stored at the time it is needed. In this way, control of the user's own data is guaranteed. 

* _<more>_

=== Availability
To achieve high availability:

* On the one hand, try to avoid making software errors by applying the code review process by other team members. The process is carried out before joining the new code with the code that already works correctly.

* On the other hand, enable autoscaling on the application's service providers in case of anticipating the success of the application. 

=== Efficiency

=== Development concept 
==== Build, Test, Deploy

=== "Under the hood"

==== Persistency
The database management system used is MongoDB and the main reason is the easiness of data passing between the database and the application based on node.js. Another reason is the feature it offers: flexible schema. 

==== Session handling
A node.js module, express-session, is used to handle the application session. There are many reasons:

* Easy to incorporate into the project as it is a node.js module.
* The session of this module is stored on the server, therefore it is more secure. 

=== Operation concepts

==== Administration

==== Management

==== Logging
Users just need to login to any Solid Pod provider to use the app. There are several advantages:

* The user does not have to register an account in the application. So he does not have to remember the password.
* Developers do not have to deal with passwords. 

==== Monitoring
