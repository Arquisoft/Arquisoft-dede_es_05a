== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Domain model

[options="header"]
.Elements of the domain model
|===
|Element|Meaning
|User|Representation of users who are logged in.
|Product|Representation of socks of the on-line shop.
|Availability|Save the stock and size of the product.
|OrderProduct|Represents products in orders.
|Order|Represents confirmed orders.
|DistributionCenter|Represents distribution centers that are in charge of send orders.

=== Architecture and Design Patterns
image:arquisocks_architecture.png["MERN Stack Architecture"]

MERN Stack is being used in the application which allows to easily create 3-tier architecture.

* **R**eact.js is used to work with the presentation layer.
* **E**xpress.js and **N**ode.js are used to make up the middle or application layer.
* **M**ongoDB is used to create the database layer.

=== Package Structure

==== Level 1

image:packageLevel1.png["Package level 1"]

The project is named dede_5a and contains the following main folders:

* *docs* is the folder that stores the files related to this documentation.
* *restapi* is the folder where the REST API that obtains data from the database is.
* *webapp* is the folder that stores everything related to the application itself.

==== Level 2

*restapi* mainly contains:

    * *routes* defines API endpoints and they are separated by database collections. 
    * *models* are representations of the data in the database. 
    * *services* contains global services like database connection.

*webapp* mainly contains:

    * *public* is the folder where the static and necessary resources for the application are located: images, scripts, etc. 
    * *src* contains the code part.

        - *api* contains calls to REST API to get data. 
        - *components* are UI components that can be used across various files in the project.
        - *contexts* contains the state which has to be shared across these components.
        - *helpers* contains commonly used functions in the project.


=== User Experience (UX)
A good User Experience is a key aspect for the success of the application. The application must satisfy the needs of the users effectively. For this, several concepts must be taken into account when designing user interfaces like:

* Usability
* Accessibility

==== Usability
Throughout development, usability tests are carried out on different users. Each test consists of small tasks that test the implemented functionalities. 

Thanks to the user's interactions with the application, usability problems can be detected and it makes it possible to make improvements in this regard. 

Usability problems make the application difficult to use and understand for users. So, it is important to avoid or reduce it.

==== Accessibility
There are different standards to follow to achieve accessibility. One of the standards is WCAG 2.0 (Level AA) which is the most used worldwide. Therefore, it is the one used in this application. 

Tools to use are:

* https://color.mediaandme.be/es[Color Test]


==== User interface
User interfaces should be designed with usability and accessibility in mind. 

===== Mockups
They may not exactly match the final design, but they offer an idea of the functionality and design of the pages that the application will have.

=== Security
Security is another key aspect to consider. Some measures to ensure security are:

* The application does not store private data of the user. To obtain it, the application asks the user for permission to access the Solid POD where the data is stored at the time it is needed. In this way, control of the user's own data is guaranteed. 

=== Availability
To achieve high availability:

* On the one hand, try to avoid making software errors by applying the code review process by other team members. The process is carried out before joining the new code with the code that already works correctly.

* On the other hand, enable autoscaling on the application's service providers in case of anticipating the success of the application. 

* Moreover, we will try to have more than one deployment technology in order to increase a high availability.

=== Efficiency
Try to have a good code quality for better performance. We will develop many load tests which are going to simulate the state of the application as it were deployed and used by many users. There are many tools to prove that. Gatling will be the reference tool to get information of the behaviour of the app. Results will be shown in the wiki which is available in our repository in GitHub. You can follow this https://github.com/Arquisoft/dede_es5a/wiki/Tests-de-carga-usando-gatling[link]

=== "Under the hood"
==== Persistency
The database management system used is MongoDB and the main reason is the easiness of data passing between the database and the application based on node.js. Another reason is the feature it offers: flexible schema. 

==== Session handling
A node.js module, express-session, is used to handle the application session. There are many reasons:

* Easy to incorporate into the project as it is a node.js module.
* The session of this module is stored on the server, therefore it is more secure. 

=== Operation concepts
==== Logging
Users just need to log in to any Solid Pod provider to use the app. There are several advantages:

* The user does not have to register an account in the application. So he does not have to remember the password.
* Developers do not have to deal with passwords.
